# _Quantum image encryption algorithm via optimized quantum circuit and parity bit-plane permutation (OCPBP)_
_The structure of the proposed OCPBP is consists of twice permutation operations and once diffusion operation.
The OCPBP algorithm comprises a total of four steps. 
Since this algorithm is quantum-based and current technology does not support quantum image quantization, we conducted simulation experiments exclusively using MATLAB._

_We employed digital image encryption techniques to simulate the encryption process of the algorithm.
The code has been implemented to encrypt grayscale images, generating key image, encrypted images, and decrypted images. 
Furthermore, we have included comments in the code to aid readers in understanding.
For RGB color images, the encryption and decryption processes can be achieved by separately encrypting the R, G, and B layers and subsequently recombining them._
